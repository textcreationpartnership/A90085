            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Woman, is a creature bringing vſually but one at a birth, but there have beene ſome who have brought forth two, ſome three, ſome four ſome five, ſome ſix, or more at one birth. <hi>Empedoches</hi> thought that tho abundance of ſeed was the cauſe of ſuch numerous birthes: the <hi>Stoiks</hi> affirme the divers cells or partitions to be the cauſe: for the ſeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing variouſly parted into theſe partitions, and the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion divided, there are more children brought no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then in rivers, the water beating againſt divers rocks, is turned into into divers circles or rounds. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith there is no reaſon to thinke ſo, for in women that parting of the wombe into cells, as in doggs and ſowes taketh no place:</p>
            <p>For womens Wombs have but one cavity, parted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two receſſes, the right and left, nothing comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween; except by chance diſtinguiſhed by a certain line, for often Twins lye in the ſame ſide of the Womb.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion is, that a woman cannot bring forth more than five children at one birth.</p>
            <p>The Maid of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> brought forth nine at a Birth, ſhe and her children dyed.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1554 at <hi>Bearn</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> the Wife of Doctor <hi>Iohn Gelinger,</hi> brought forth five children at one Birth, three Boyes and two Girls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albuccaſis</hi> affirms a Woman to have bin the Mother of ſeven children at one Birth; and another, who by ſome externall injury did abort, brought forth five perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, ſhaped in all their parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, that it was extant in the Writings of Phyſitians, that 12. children were born at one birth, and that there was another in <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> which 4. ſeverall times was delivered of five children at one birth; and that the greater part of thoſe children lived.</p>
            <p>It is reported by <hi>Dalechampius</hi> that <hi>Bonaventura</hi> the ſlave of one <hi>Savill,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Sena,</hi> at one time brought forth 7. children: of which 4. were baptized in
<pb facs="tcp:156630:4"/>our time, between <hi>Sarte</hi> and <hi>Main</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Seaux,</hi> not far from <hi>Chambella:</hi> there is a Family and noble Houſe called <hi>Maldemeure,</hi> the wife of the Lord <hi>Malde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meure:</hi> the firſt year ſhe was marryed, brought forth twins: the ſecond year ſhe had three children: the third year 4. the fourth year five: the fifth year ſix, and of that Birth ſhe dyed.</p>
            <p>Of theſe ſix one is yet alive, and is Lord of <hi>Malde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meur.</hi> In the valley of <hi>Beaufors,</hi> in the County of <hi>Anion:</hi> a young woman the daughter of <hi>Mace Channier,</hi> when at one perfect birth ſhe had brought form one child, the tenth day following ſhe fell in labour of of another, but could not be delivered vntill it was plucked from her by force, and was the death of the mother. <hi>Martin Cromerus</hi> that author of the <hi>Poliſh hiſtory,</hi> writeth that one <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> a woman ſprung from a noble and ancient family near <hi>Cracovia</hi> and wife to <hi>Count Virboſlaus,</hi> brought forth at one Birth 35 living children vpon the 20th. day of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary.</hi> In the yeare. 1296, <hi>Franſiſcus Picus Mirandula</hi> writeth, that one <hi>Dorothy</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> had twenty children at two births, at the firſt 9 at the ſecony 11, and that ſhe was ſo big that ſhe was forced to bear vp her belly which lay vpon her knees, with a broad and large ſcarfe tyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her necke, as you may ſee by divers authours.</p>
